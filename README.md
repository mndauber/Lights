Clements Competition Problem #6 - Lights
This is my answer to the competition problem from 2015 Clements Programming UIL competition.
The Problem is found in the pdf in the repo.
I did this problem in such a way that it does not read from a file, although that was how the problem was designed in the pdf file. 
I just created the methods, some of them overloaded, so that the same "instructions" seen in the sample input code in the pdf have been converted into methods.
